      > Constant change is at the centre of this interactive and destructive game: it reflects the unsteady, dynamic conditions of our world 
      and forces players to adapt flexibly to changing game rules and objectives. <br><br>
      > At the same time, it promotes a deeper understanding of relational and situational ways of thinking and acting and thus offers an insight 
      into possible post-human working methods.
